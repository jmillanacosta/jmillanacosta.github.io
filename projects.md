# Some projects

- [The eNanoMapper Ontology](https://github.com/enanomapper/ontologies): I took over the development and release cycle of the eNM ontology in July 2022.
- [Retractable](https://www.jmillanacosta.com/retractable): a database of retracted papers aiming to provide insight into the reasons they got retracted.
