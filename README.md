# About me

I am a PhD candidate in the Bioinformatics department at Maastricht University, [BiGCaT](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/bioinformatics). My research interests include the application of knowledge representation, semantics and NLP into biotech research. In my PhD project I am researching ontologies and knowledge graphs as a means to integrate and analyze data on all things nano. The [projects](/projects) page contains an overview of some things I have been working on.
